 <h1>AUTOPSY METROPOLIS <span id="excerpt">(excerpt)</span></h1>
 <h2>Michael S. Judge</h2>
          <p>
<span class="text-indent">a cylinder of near-translucent fluid &#8212; set up carefully, lone object in your sight, </span>against the light depriving all its flesh of any object status in the eye, all such definition as implies a waiting depth and any edge more awfully lost now than the frame's celluloid border to the corpses caught on film, cinematography of myogram star's needle-voltage slipping through strict anticline of sarcomere hypogeum and up the steps, away, all past the infrared or night-vision eyes, the higher spectra all sent back and paroxysmal, still, with the repeated heats of their rejection, recurrent temperatures in visible ripple down the body, not much less than ecstatic for them and, for us, not much more than ecstasy observed, god help, and "help" alone, since targets of divine aid seem, at best, to swing toward the self-determined, the arrow finding the wind it should less meld with than draw friction from, as thin black hair pulled tight that we might fiddle gaunt starving horses' whisper from the strands, as offline DC transformer of sarcophagus-LAN star blowing the hundred thousand volts up on the telephone poles cold enough to touch for just a moment or quite less, really, more in a moment's skin, labial action of first consonantal nasals bursting membrane on demagnetized echography of wire-recorder star, and there we are and were; set up against such tungsten impurities as should impart the flicker of fictive flashbulbs, the brief squarewave hailstorm, wavetable star's analog synthesis deprived radiosurgery now rescued from the echelons of bunkers sent way back, back, back
<br>
   <span class="text-indent">long as you could ask, less for the asking than dredged out of the foreshortened interrogatives, </span>the maximum character length of anything that begins and ends with question marks, one of which must be upside down and either of which may be, depending on proclivities' abrupt necessitation and the way you'd seem to tilt there, up against the ATP star's codestring login, hitting falsified blockchain ledger of the flight-recorder blackbox with xenonucleic star's acid tape-delay backbone till we should all fall down, cinders of half-alleged posies in the pockets and the black carbonized shape of flowers' absence from the dirt now carved purple and subcutaneous on your cheek, as shouldn't it be, as liquid-crystallography of enantiomer lysosome-star's affine map phagocytosis fixing now on bits of false glass burnt or merely scalded into the image of a fixity they're never really mind to find and often find regardless of dim meaning, where it's all dim and remains so, down and way down, stratigraphy below the dry radio hiss of the redshift star's transducer brownout in the cardioid mic diaphragm's confused induction pumping velar motion back into the speakers' shiver, the thick paper cones gone porous if not punctured here &#8212; you ought, I'd say, remember &#8212; down and down past ruby light at the core-sample star's fuel cylinder for ziggurat heart-sacrifice, and blood not "only" blood there, not, as long across the several seas, the meat and water of the stars, but more a question of light's necessary deformation here, a way to mutate the blackening and leveling impulses of the sun, an early kind of solid-state compression, if you like, before we wholly scrape the oxide from the tape, wholly degauss cuneiform surgery of acetate encephalogram star, 
    <br>
<span class="text-indent">it's about flatness there, and flatness half-remembered for the vicious downward force, </span>the actual feeling &#8212; you can mock it up as many times as you like, maybe even commission and construct as "space program," as if the program were for space and not, precisely, its abridgement &#8212; of having your brain pushed against your brainpan, which is clear enough a few moments after it's over but which, in the necessary seconds, defies all clarity whatever.  Severed hoses flail to spray cerebrospinal liquid from waveshaper star's fluidic-computer terminal, and nothing but the falling then, the empty recourse of the drowned, grabbing onto accessible fistfuls of useless water as you too would clutch at the air, like you could pull it in through helpless skin and feed it somehow to the prejudicial precincts of the blood, now black and clotted at extremes of all your cranial extension, molecular-architecture star's cephalopod signal-path flow suddenly more obvious than even briefly smoldered intuition of flux linkage from the one coil to the other, transformers' first and secondary wires all disconnected up and down the spade-clipped tabs and nubs of any process, xiphoid, spinous, howsoever you should try and fail to grasp, solder's rosin flux re-lit now and abruptly sloped debridement from the axon-terminal star's bootscreen pictography, as
<br>
<span class="text-indent">it should matter, and it does, but quite as thoroughly in total flat  </span>confusion as in anything to be "learned" afterward.  Blood pouring from your ears, either blacker and slower or redder and thinner and quicker than you can quite believe, either the clotted solar autopsy you imagined lurching for hours from the throat of the bullock slain over the baptismal grate, right, or the narrow hemorrhage of ferrous time itself, the repeated superfices of the film-crew wrackage tracking wounded-hyperlink star's plane crash into aneurysmal obelisk, as
<br>
<span class="text-indent">all may yet proceed or, in its stilted process, still half-seem to "prove,"  </span>or seem to half-prove, which aren't and have never been the same thing, despite their frequent and half-mutual confusion.  Down through all the pseudorandom-number generators and the REM scatter reduced, or sped, to 24 fps on exobiologic star's dead-URL necropolis, whatever painful act of varispeed should re-confuse the sums and thus the differences remaining, where you come to that more primal act in precedent of simple "mathematics," the cutting off, the amputation with the phantom pain not merely an extension of poor cautery but spreading now to all "surviving" limbs, since none survive the sudden breach of strict bodily dreaming, the awareness, now, of flesh's long conspiracy against them and the way they've helped, and event meant, to nurse the epidemic that decides as to their uselessness when flesh becomes decision, and we wrap cold in the newly-tilted binaries, tags open, unimaginably dull against the toothaching blue-whiteness of the skull, feeling more volt-intensive afference shut down, seek-judder in the reboot panics less a strict affliction than a tenet of the seasons we forget
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="text-indent">dark now &#8212; dark then &#8212; but all things faintly glowing, half-obscenely, </span>with the wet heat they would strain to spill as light, the humid wood's veins swollen to phloemic thrombosis, the moon clearly as ever some disfigurement of canceled pores and proud flesh's bitter assignation with the wounded meat below, burial mound for glyph-transcription star's mutagen surgery half-strata, strewn to shards, impossible to count as whole or broken without reference to whatever "wholes" might look like save a regional accent lathing down the aspirate or its lack at the beginning of that indrawn breath revers, a word like choking played backward, mono Dictaphone mixdown from cell-recording star's wire drum, and precious little as addition save piezo jolt exploding in bright brief xylemic crystal through the body, top/sides/back, or in the straining neck, drawn off in wan meniscus of a honey much diluted, serologic star's canopic teletype as chatter of black smaller bones consigned thus to the crumpling of the ears, the flesh so crippled as to allow some local healing, malleic smoke and all the tiny sonar clink of anvils crumbling to your touch, or to the faint notion of touch besides, as when wavetable star transduced coordinate systems out of pitch toward phosphorescence and straight back into night-soluble varietals of fluid-damaged software, 
<br>
<span class="text-indent">as you would know, or more or less presume, having been there or close enough, </span>all Demeter's sloughs and wallows slick there, wholly out of season and thus perhaps half a surprise, where codon-scanning star's .txt exobiology records for bitter broadcast the blown-out and squarer-than-square wave born of skipping steps, or of dim recovery to add what's skipped back, material panic pure enough to prove that the universe itself is not just capable of fear but is in terrible anxious flux most of the time, attempting to preclude the broken acid and so driving the next triode gain stage violently toward ATP-star nucleotide clipping, a ratio of input to compression you would never find unless you flat went looking to peddle and conceive this sort of "accident," blackbox login to the frameshift star's dead-URL necropolis now turning on a series of intentional amino "errors" each designed as proof against a pseudorandom codestring,
<br>
<span class="text-indent">toward precise degrees of likelihood, the numbed or overeager time in wooden houses </span>creaking loud as scattered corncrakes against the temperature shift of the afternoon, you understand, tape-edit override its evidence not just of a mistake but of some action somewhere taken as a camouflage retreating, desperately present there, unable to hide itself and so declaring what it otherwise should stammer to forget: yes sure we fucked up and there may be several seconds missing here I'm not entirely sure and I know that you know that I'd be lying if I claimed any kind of certainty even with the matrices and spreadsheets all laid out for average capstan cycle speed and feet per minute and the ferrous-oxide loss of frameshift star's cellular surgery beneath such pitch-warp gene-expression factors as must be considered more or less endemic and should be, if not planned for, because who's to plan for the precision of the errors of the Earth, I mean goddamn it, really, who's to ask against nerve spindle's errant firing or demyelinate sheath toward blackout-manic MIDI triggering xenonucleic star's cassette, 
<br>
<span class="text-indent">you're all smarter than that, I hope; you were all trained to feign a broader </span>and a wiser and a sadder sort of intelligence, if I'm not sure, no I'm quite sure, if I'm not wrong?; to shake your heads somewhere quite near, but never up against (who knows what's touching them, what slime mold capable of growing inside the coils of your ear where the Minotaur screams, who knows what labyrinthine feedback spiral of harmonic overgrowth's long FM synthesis might sum to mycological neural-network star's fracturous LAN, able to break itself, able to break whatever it should touch by mention only, to shatter by inference and, best of all, to corrupt by palimpsest, over and over atop what's atop, and we should all, I think here, I think not to know, I think only to enunciate an exact degree of such corruption, right?, to name it to the microsecond, picofarad, single ohm's resistance, to check the cold reactor cores in years of decommissioned xenosurgical star orbiting right in the gamma fraction with the specious cures for cancer and the decibels we daren't name for fear of us, ourselves, lending the meat and bone and blood to one of those statistics?, I think
<br>
<span class="text-indent">not to come to any conclusion but to mark the moment on the reel where somebody disastrously </span>started to think, epigenetic drift of aniline star's permeable carcinogen rainbow still less apt to float through the window, since it's the necessary almost-monotone of Historical Footage, something happening AtAnotherTime, wink or don't even bother, hardly needful now, and everything is one or another shade of brown, and everything is not just fading in front of your eyes but is thus disintegrating as a promise, as a fade toward your salvation, and christ, if you believe that now or even feel it someway sleek becoming to bestow belief's emphatic choreography upon it, well, there's nothing very much to tell you anymore, not to be heard at least.  Mount the steps, take up the fine scansion of X-ray separate, put the edible cartilage beneath the autodial rotary phone software of the gamma-knife star, careful to absorb as much as leaks from the old batteries or licks you sharp and short from thus uneven joins where cloth wire was replaced with New-Look Teflon! was replaced with cloth again and, now, who know, some nightmare crystallography, polyurethane grown in the wombs of species otherwise extinct, censored venography of benzene-ring star's gene-torching splitting alkaloid infinitives on any such report as you might even half-declassify, i.e. get them to gesture toward the naming and the number, get a videotape whereon the automatic closed-captioning appears to refer to the alphanumeric sequence which you're trying to track down, only appears, mind you, but that's the short of stuff you learn to live with, slant neon snowcrash /directory of glyph-mutation star's oil-barren pharmacogenomics
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="text-indent">mumbling, whispering, then half-whispering numb triadic backing vocals to the anger, </span>the bafflement, the druggy resignation of control room scarcely heard through headphones long removed, at least, we'll come to tell ourselves, at least to lay out some index of lithium damage in that Faire Field of Enna for those who come after and may be less prepared to run when the horror begins, or yet much less prepared to recognize and, even still, acknowledge the mere presence of the horror, if you'd ask and if you'd try and if you'd merely start to run yourself with eyes grown overlarge, oh the awe-hungry swelling darkness of the pupils aimed right into that cracked lens itself athirst for dark, and who could know and, knowing, say, who make atonement or chisel in past visage for the runic spinal library of biointerface star's hippocampal runtime-script transduction, less language to language or even text to text than question of which of the main electrical properties is to be most immediately feared her, among young women who arrived in this place by frightening means and have had to leave frightening things behind in a frightening manner to keep themselves within the fictive temenos, the very-soon-seen-for-hell-ugly circle of thinner-than-imaginary protections, more diluted, based in less, the sickened mineral flavor of the water where it pushes up through inexplicably dry and cracked ground, the substrate opposition of the canceled-out exponents in transliterate RAM cache of exobiologic star's few fluent microseconds switching in and out before the automatic pingback, the immediate and uncontrolled blood-function of strange characters, oh christ and help you all and I mean it, the hungry intravenous fiction climbing from the ceiling to the floor in radiosurgical scar's neural scan to dredge, to hold, to sell what foul dendritic silt may sleep yet in the myograph star's rhizomatous-stilled clangor circuit-architecture built of axon terminals re-canceled,
<br>
<span class="text-indent">once brought up and once worn down and more than many times the subject </span>for a sniper's heart, dear help-ye-god, the half-bodily scripts of nearly ancient tribulation writ in ragged "silk," i.e. more likely polyurethane or, unlikely but possible, nitrocellulose, to print transliterate gain-staged circuit anatomy of ATP star's ROM-blanked cinematography, and
<br>

none ever is; the terms are simply acquiesced to, in an age of very little aside from acquiescence, some quite simple, some disgustingly complex, but all come ultimately thus far down, this deep into a cheap CGI labyrinth of bafflement wherein we only need to render two or three sharp turns before the operators always just give up, you understand?, it's what they call "interactive," it's known in the business as one of the sub-businesses, and it's known in one of those sub-businesses as a "feedback loop," which is precisely what it isn't.  They set the terms.  You persist as long as you still feel you're making some kind of point with persistence.  You persist, perhaps, because you've never learned that you're supposed to quit.  You persist because you know it can't lead anywhere and hope the shutdown meets you as a suicide that cannot be distinguished from a glitch.)
